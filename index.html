      <p>India, a country with a Tele-Density of <b><i>113</i> connection per <i>100</i> user</b> stands as a second largest 
        in terms of Telecommunication reach. The rapid urbanization in specific regions of India has driven Tele-Density in
      there area to new heights, fostering a robust ecosystem for digital transaction.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 25px;">Overall Tele-Density of India from 2014 to 2022</p>
      <img src="./assets/img/overallTeleYear.png" alt="line chart for overall Tele-Density in India">
      <p style="margin-top: 35px;">The teledensity increased sharply, indicating a significant rise in the number of telephone connections.
        Teledensity reached its peak, reflecting the highest number of telephone connections for inhabitants. 
        The decline continued, though at a slower rate, implying stabilization at a high level but with potential influences like the
        impact of new technologies or market dynamics.

      <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 25px;">Urban Tele-Density of India from 2014 to 2022</p>
      <img src="./assets/img/urbanTeleYear.png" alt="line chart for Urban Tele-Density in India">
      <p style="margin-top: 35px;">There was a sharp increase in urban teledensity, indicating rapid growth in the number 
        of telephone connections in urban areas. A noticeable decline in urban teledensity began, suggesting possible market 
        saturation or other factors impacting the number of connections. The downward trend continued, although at a slower rate, 
        stabilizing at a lower level compared to the peak years.

      <img src="./assets/img/RuralTeleYear.png" alt="line chart for Rural Tele-Density in India">
      <p style="margin-top: 35px;margin-bottom: 100px;"> A sharp increase in rural teledensity, indicating a significant rise in the number 
        of telephone connections in rural areas. The teledensity growth began to plateau, suggesting that the initial rapid expansion was 
        stabilizing as the rural market matured.  A slight decline in teledensity occurred, indicating potential market saturation or other 
        influencing factors.

      <p style="margin-top: 35px;margin-bottom: 100px;"> A sharp increase in rural teledensity, indicating a significant rise in the number 
        of telephone connections in rural areas. The teledensity growth began to plateau, suggesting that the initial rapid expansion was 
        stabilizing as the rural market matured.  A slight decline in teledensity occurred, indicating potential market saturation or other
